# Blog Front-end

The front-end of the blog application, built with React, offers a seamless and interactive user experience. 
It allows users to browse, read, and manage blog posts with features such as post creation, editing, and deletion. 
Users can search and filter content, and the application is integrated with Google authentication to ensure secure and easy access. 
It communicates with a Node.js server for the back-end and PostgreSQL for the database.
